### The Linux Kernel ###

A snapshot of a flurry of development on the [Linux](http://www.linux.org/) project.

As Linux is a huge C language project, the files being worked on are predominately a mix of **.c** (shown in green) and **.h** header files (in red).

### Git SCM ###

The [Git SCM](http://git-scm.com/) Project, one of the main version control systems supported by Gource.

Unlike many projects, most of the files of the Git project reside in several huge directories of hundreds of files, rather than being broken down into sub directories.

Git has a similar mix of colours to Linux as it is also written in C. The large orange directory contains **.txt** files (orange).
