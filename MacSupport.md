## Homebrew ##

You can get Gource via [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/):

```
brew install gource
```

This is typically more up to date than the version via Macports.

## Macports ##

Gource is also in [Macports](http://www.macports.org/). [Once you have installed Macports](http://www.macports.org/install.php) you can install gource with this command:

```
sudo port install gource
```
